# ECE50024 - Project - Conditional-GANs
**Final Project for ECE 50024 - Machine Learning  
Topic: Conditional GANs  
Owner: Suhaib Khan**

**Code Running Explanation**  

Please run the .py file directly "Conditional GAN Code - Final.py" to see the model results.  
Use the command YOUR-PATH\python "Conditional GAN Code - Final.py"  

The program will run on pretrained checkpoint #4 by default.  
To check results of other checkpoints, change 'cp_index' from [0,9] at line 373.  
 
To train a new model, change 'new_train' to True at line 335.   
To enable model checkpointing, change 'save_bool' to True at line 332.  

I am also attaching the python notebook which has outputs presented in the research paper.  

Please note that I made a few changes in the .py file to allow easy access through command line.
